# INFO 

We received the following string:

`wymul aluncum uai ncvc kocu ch ijncgog yayn yluhn wog jluymylncg ihym xihyw aluncum uai ncvc kocu hih mwcly koug ux pyrcffog gusvy u jluywcjci pivcm: bilct0hr{liguh_yhwlsjncih_cm_yums_ni_lypylmy}`

Okey. Right. So the name of this challenge is antiquity, so what's about CeasarCipher ? The text appears like just a rotation of letter. 

Let's bruteforce it with the ceasarcipher methods. (with `script.py`)

# Script

- for loop to shift through the whole alphabet
- ceasaring with the current offset
- printing the flag

# Gotcha !
